Weekend Market Stall Booking is a software application designed to help manage and automate the process of booking stalls at weekend markets, flea markets, fairs, exhibitions, and similar events. The system enables vendors and event organizers to list available market stalls, browse stall details, check availability, and reserve spaces conveniently using a digital platform.

This project provides core functionalities such as viewing available stalls, selecting preferred stall positions or dates, and completing the booking process. It can also include features for managing stall inventory, tracking bookings, and recording vendor information in a structured database, making the whole process more efficient compared to traditional manual booking methods.

The application improves transparency, organization, and ease of use for both stall owners and market administrators, allowing them to handle reservations, schedules, and event participation with greater accuracy and convenience.
